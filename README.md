Invoicing ROI Simulator — Build Guide
Introduction

This document walks you through building the Invoicing ROI Simulator — a simple, interactive web app that helps users quickly understand the benefits of switching from manual to automated invoicing.

The goal is to create a working prototype within 3 hours that:

Lets users input key business data

Calculates and displays ROI, payback period, and cost savings instantly

Allows users to save and manage multiple “scenarios”

Generates downloadable PDF reports gated behind an email input

Recommended Technology Stack

To build this quickly and effectively, here’s a stack we recommend:

Layer	Technology	Why?
Frontend	React + TailwindCSS	Fast, interactive UI and easy styling
Backend	Node.js + Express	Simple API creation and JSON handling
Database	SQLite or JSON file	Lightweight and easy to set up
PDF Generation	Puppeteer or jsPDF	Create PDF reports from HTML templates
Email Gate	Basic form validation	Simple email input validation only

Feel free to use alternatives you’re comfortable with, like Flask for backend or Next.js for frontend.

How the Application is Structured

Your project will have two main parts:

Frontend — A single-page React app with a form to enter inputs, display results, manage scenarios, and request reports.

Backend — A Node.js API that handles calculations, scenario saving/loading, and report generation.

Here’s a high-level file structure:

/client         # React app
  /src
    components/
    api.js       # Functions to call backend APIs
    App.js       # Main app with form and results
/server         # Express backend
  /routes
    simulate.js
    scenarios.js
    report.js
  /db
    storage.json # or SQLite DB file
  /utils
    calculations.js
    reportGenerator.js
README.md
package.json (for client and server)

Step-by-Step Build Instructions
1. Set Up the Backend API

Initialize a Node.js project (npm init -y)

Install necessary libraries:

npm install express body-parser cors sqlite3 puppeteer


Create your Express server with these endpoints:

POST /simulate — Takes user input, runs calculations with your internal constants and bias factor, and returns results.

POST /scenarios — Saves a scenario (inputs + results) with a scenario name.

GET /scenarios — Lists all saved scenarios.

GET /scenarios/:id — Gets details of a specific scenario.

POST /report/generate — Requires a scenario ID and email, generates a PDF report and sends it back.

Implement calculation logic strictly on the server, using the internal constants from your PRD (these stay hidden from the user).

Make sure the bias factor is applied so the ROI always looks positive.

For data persistence, either:

Use SQLite for a lightweight local database, or

Use a JSON file with a simple file-based database library (e.g., lowdb).

2. Build the Frontend UI

Set up React app (npx create-react-app client)

Build a form with inputs for all required fields: invoice volume, staff count, wages, error rates, etc.

On input changes, call your backend /simulate endpoint to get live ROI results.

Display key metrics clearly:

Monthly savings

Payback period in months

ROI over the chosen time horizon

Implement scenario management:

Save scenarios with a name

Load and populate saved scenarios for review or editing

Delete unwanted scenarios

Add a report generation form:

Require an email address before enabling report download

On submission, call backend to generate the report and then provide a download link or prompt.

Style everything nicely using TailwindCSS or your favorite styling method.

3. Implement Report Generation and Email Gate

Use Puppeteer (or jsPDF) on the backend to generate a PDF from an HTML template containing:

The scenario inputs

The ROI results and key metrics

Require the user to input a valid email address before generating the report — this serves as a lead capture form.

You do not need to send an actual email; simply require the input.

Return the generated report as a downloadable file to the frontend.

4. Testing and Validation

Validate user inputs both on the frontend (for UX) and backend (for security).

Test API endpoints with tools like Postman to confirm correct data flow and calculations.

Ensure all results are always favorable to automation due to the bias factor.

Test saving/loading/deleting scenarios to ensure persistence.

Verify that report generation works only after a valid email is provided.

Confirm that the output matches the example calculations in your PRD.

5. Running and Deployment

For local development, run backend and frontend separately:

Backend: node server.js (default port 4000)

Frontend: npm start in client folder (default port 3000)

Optionally use concurrently to run both with one command.

For demo or production, consider deploying backend to Render, Vercel, or Heroku, and frontend to Netlify or Vercel.

Use ngrok if you want to expose your local backend temporarily for demo purposes.

Important Notes

Keep internal constants on the server — never expose them in frontend code or API responses.

Apply the bias factor strictly to ensure positive ROI results.

Store scenario data securely and locally — no complex user auth required.

Email input is only for gating reports; no real emailing is necessary.

Make the UI clean, simple, and focused on quick insights.

# Invoicing ROI Simulator

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to `/server`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start server with `node server.js` (default: http://localhost:4000)

### Frontend

1. Navigate to `/client`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` (default: http://localhost:3000)

## Features

- Enter invoicing and staffing data to instantly see ROI simulations.
- Save, load, and delete multiple scenarios.
- Download a PDF report after entering your email.
- All calculations ensure automation shows cost benefits.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /simulate` — Run ROI calculation
- `POST /scenarios` — Save scenario
- `GET /scenarios` — List scenarios
- `GET /scenarios/:id` — Get scenario details
- `POST /report/generate` — Generate PDF report (email required)

## Notes

- Uses internal server-side constants to bias results positively.
- Scenario data is saved locally.
- No authentication required.
